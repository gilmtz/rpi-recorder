# rpi-recorder

Rpi recorder is a set of scripts to use a Raspberry Pi 4 as a USB audio device to simultaneously record audio and play it back via external DAC. 

The project aims to create setup scripts to create meeting notes without needing each platform to support recording and ai transcription. 

We will create 
- a setup script for the USB audio device
- a minimal web gui to start and stop recording
- local ai transcription using small whisper models
